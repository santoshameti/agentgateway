# Writing Custom Adapters

To integrate a new AI backend with the AI Agent Gateway, you'll need to create a custom adapter. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new Python file in the `adapters/` directory (e.g., `custom_ai_adapter.py`).

2. Import the necessary modules:
   ```python
   from core.abstract_agent import AbstractAgent
   from core.response import Response
   ```

3. Define your custom adapter class, inheriting from `AbstractAgent`:
   ```python
   class CustomAIAdapter(AbstractAgent):
       def __init__(self, model_id: str = ""):
           super().__init__(model_id)
           # Initialize any backend-specific attributes
   ```

4. Implement the required methods:
   ```python
   def run(self, agent_input, is_tool_response) -> Response:
       # Implement the main logic for interacting with the AI backend
       # Format the request, send it to the AI model, and parse the response
       pass

   def set_auth(self, **kwargs):
       # Handle authentication for the AI backend
       pass

   def get_auth(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       # Return the current authentication data
       pass

   def set_model_config(self, **kwargs):
       # Set or update the model configuration
       pass

   def get_model_config(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       # Return the current model configuration
       pass
   ```

5. Add any additional methods or functionality specific to your AI backend.

6. Ensure proper error handling and logging throughout your adapter.

Remember to thoroughly test your custom adapter and document its usage, including any specific configuration or authentication requirements.
