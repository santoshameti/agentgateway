# AI Agent Gateway Documentation

Welcome to the AI Agent Gateway documentation. This guide will help you understand, set up, and use the AI Agent Gateway to create and run AI agents with various tools and AI backends.

## What is AI Agent Gateway?

AI Agent Gateway is a flexible and powerful tool designed to simplify the process of working with AI agents. By abstracting away the complexity of various AI backends, it provides a unified interface for creating and running AI agents with a variety of tools.

## Key Features

- Support for multiple AI backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Vertex AI)
- Extensible tool system with built-in tools for weather, calculations, and translations
- Secure management of API keys using environment variables
- Easy-to-use interface for creating and running AI agents
