# Tools Overview

Tools in the AI Agent Gateway are modular components that extend the capabilities of AI agents. They allow agents to perform specific tasks or access external services, enhancing their functionality and versatility.

Key points about tools:

1. Tools are based on the `Tool` abstract base class.
2. Each tool has a name, description, and set of parameters.
3. Tools can require authentication for accessing external services.
4. The AI Agent Gateway provides built-in tools and supports custom tool creation.

Tools play a crucial role in enabling agents to interact with external systems, process data, and perform specialized tasks beyond their base language capabilities.
